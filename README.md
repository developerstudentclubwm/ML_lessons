# Workshops

# Cheat sheets

- [Choosing a the right model based on data constraints](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/ml_map.png) (source: the `sklearn` library)

# General Resources

- **Python:**
  -  [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): for general machine learning methods and convenience methods for metrics, preprocessing data, model selection, and more!
  -  [Keras](https://keras.io/): a simple python interface for designing, training, and evaluating neural networks
  -  [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): a more involved framework for working with neural networks--particulrly suitable for research
