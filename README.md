# Cheat sheets

- [Choosing the right model based on data constraints](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/ml_map.png) (source: the `sklearn` library)

# General Resources

- **Python:**
  -  [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): for general machine learning methods and convenience methods for metrics, preprocessing data, model selection, and more!
  -  [`Keras`](https://keras.io/): a simple python interface for designing, training, and evaluating neural networks
  -  [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/): a more involved framework for working with neural networks--particulrly suitable for research
- **R**:
  - [`Tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/): one of the premier packages for machine learning in R--notably, this integrates very with other "tidy" packages such as those from the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- **Learning about machine learning:**
  -  [Free deep learning textbook](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/): a very thorough exploration of deep learning and neural networks, all the way from basics to cutting edge research
  -  [Free reinforcement learning textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf): a preprint textbook (mostly complete) that inlcudes a full development on reinforcement learning (basics to the cuttting edge)
  -  [Free math textbook](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf): all of the math concepts that you need to know to be prepared to engage with the more theoretical aspects of machine learning
